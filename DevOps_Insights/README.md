# DevOps Insights

## Business Value Comparison

High-performing organizations using DevOps practises outperforming their non-high performing peers in the following areas:

- Throughput metrics (30x more frequent)
- Code and change deployment lead time  (200x faster)
- Reliability metrics
- Production deployment (60x times higher change success rate)
- Mean time to restore service (168x faster)
- Organizational performance metrics
- Productivity, market share, and profitability goals (2x more likely to exceed)
- Market capitalization growth (50% higher over three years)


Part I

High level principles of the Three Ways: Flow, Feedback, Continual Learning and Experimentation

Part II

How and there t ostart
Present concepts: Value streams, Organizational Design Principles and Patterns, Organizational Adoption Patterns, Case Studies.

Part III 

How to oaccelerate Flow by building the foundations of our deployment pipeline: Enabling fast and effective automated testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and architecting for low-risk releases.

Part IV 

Discusses how to accelerate and amplify Feedback by creating effective production telemetry to see and solve problems, better anticipate problems and achieve goals, enable feedback so that Deva nd Ops can safely deploy changes, integrate A/B testing into our daily work, and create review and coordination processes to increase the quality of our work


Part V

Descirbes how we accelerate Continual Learning by establishing a just culture, converting local discoveries into global improvements, and properly reserving time to create organizational learning and improvements

Part VI

We describe how to properly integrate security and compliance into our daily work, by integrating preventative security controls into shared source code repositiories and services, Intergrating Security into our Deployment pipeline, enhancing telemetry to better enable detection and recovery, protecting the deployment pipeline, and achieving change management objectives.

## Part I

DevOps is the outcome of applying the most trusted principles from the domain of physical manufacturing and leadership to the IT value stream. DevOps relies on bodies of knowledge from Lean, Theory of Constraints, the Toyota Production System, resilience engineering, learning organizations, safety culture, human factors, and many others.
