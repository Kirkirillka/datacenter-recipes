In this repository you can find out a simple Python web microservice. Git flow is used as branching model. However, 
the last release is not finished yet. 

![Used commits for this exercise](images/git_tree.png)

- The starting commit: c48ae1c6
- Ending commit: c77b8137 (development branch python_develop)

You have to complete the next release (the next release branch - python_master) and push repository into GitHub and GitLab.

Your tasks:

1. Read theoretical material. 
2. Register in GitHub and GitLab, create public empty repositories.
3. Repeat all commits using `git flow` branch model, describe the meaning for each of branch.
4. Run the microservice  code, add comments if required.
5. Complete the next release.
5. Add new remotes (targets are GitHub and GitLab) and push your changes.
